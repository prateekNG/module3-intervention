## JavaScript Learning Stations: Objectives and Scope

This document outlines the learning objectives and scope for a series of JavaScript programming stations designed to introduce fundamental concepts.

**General Notes:**

* **Collaboration:** Students are encouraged to collaborate effectively within their groups to solve problems and complete challenges. 
* **Code Clarity:** Students should be able to explain their code and logic clearly.
* **Accuracy and Efficiency:** Students should strive for accuracy and efficiency in their code.

### Station 1: Variables, Operators, and Conditions

**Objective:**  Students will be able to declare and assign numeric variables, perform arithmetic operations, and utilize comparison operators within conditional statements (if, else if, else) to control program flow.

**Scope:**

* **Variables and Data Types:**
    * Declare variables using `let`.
    * Assign numeric values to variables.
    * Focus solely on the `Number` data type. 
* **Input/Output:**
    * Use `questionInt()` from `readline-sync` for numeric user input.
    * Use `console.log()` to display output.
* **Operators:**
    * Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`.
    * Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.
    * Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
* **Conditional Statements:**
    * `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements for decision-making.
    * Understand the logical order of conditional statement execution.
    * Chaining multiple `if else` statements to handle various conditions.

**Challenge Example:** Determine if a given year is a leap year.

### Station 2: While Loops

**Objective:** Students will be able to construct and utilize `while` loops to repeat code blocks based on a condition, including nested loops for more complex iterations.

**Scope:**

* **Loops:**
    * Understand the concept and purpose of loops in programming.
    * Construct `while` loops with conditions that evaluate to true or false.
    * Control loop iterations using `+=` and `-=` operators.
    * Create nested `while` loops for iterations within iterations.
    * Apply loop concepts to generate number-based patterns (strings are out of scope).

**Challenge Example:** Calculate the factorial of a given number. 

### Station 3: One-Dimensional Arrays

**Objective:** Students will be able to declare, initialize, access, and modify elements within one-dimensional arrays containing numeric values.

**Scope:**

* **Arrays:**
    * Understand arrays as ordered collections of data.
    * Declare one-dimensional arrays to store numeric data.
    * Initialize arrays with numeric values during declaration.
    * Access individual array elements using their index (zero-based indexing).
    * Modify the values of individual array elements.
    * **Note:** Array methods (beyond accessing and modifying elements) are outside the scope.

**Challenge Example:**  Find the largest/smallest element in an array, reverse the array, or search for a specific value.
