## 1-Hour Activity: JavaScript Learning Stations (Revised)

This activity takes a relay race approach to engage three student groups (A, B, and C) with basic JavaScript. Each group will progress through three stations focused on specific JavaScript concepts, solving engaging coding challenges. 

**Overall Goal:** To foster collaborative problem-solving, coding accuracy, and clear explanation of logic.

**Setup**:

1. **Station 1: Building Blocks (Variables, Operators, Conditions)**
2. **Station 2: Looping Magic (While Loops)**
3. **Station 3: Data Wizards (One-Dimensional Arrays)**

Each station will have:

* **Instruction Sheet:** Clear explanations, examples, and hints related to the topic.
* **Challenge Card:**  A coding problem aligned with the station's objectives.
* **Station Facilitator (Optional):** To provide guidance and clarification (can be a teacher, teaching assistant, or a designated student).

**Activity Flow:**

1. **Team Formation:** Divide the class into three groups (A, B, C), ensuring a mix of skill levels.
2. **Station Allocation:** Each group starts at a designated station.
3. **Challenge Time:**  Groups work collaboratively to solve the challenge on their station's card.  
4. **Rotation:** Once a group successfully completes a challenge (verified by the teacher or facilitator), they move to the next station in a clockwise rotation. 
5. **Final Round:** The activity continues until all groups have attempted all three stations. 

**Scoring:**

* **Code Accuracy (Primary):**  Does the code produce the correct output?
* **Time Taken:**  Faster completion with accuracy earns more points.
* **Logic Explanation:**  Groups briefly explain their code and solution approach to the teacher. Clear and concise explanations earn additional points.

**🏆 Winning Team:** The team with the highest cumulative score across all stations wins! 🏆

## Detailed Station Challenges:

**Station 1: Building Blocks**

**Instruction Sheet:**

* Recap of variables (using `let`), data types (`Number` only), arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, `console.log()`, and `questionInt()` from the `readline-sync` package. 
* Examples of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for decision-making.

**Challenge Card:**

**Ticket Price Calculator**

* Ask the user for their age using `questionInt()`.
* If the user is younger than 5, the ticket is free!
* If the user is between 5 and 12 (inclusive), the ticket price is ₹50. 
* If the user is older than 12, the ticket price is ₹100.
* Display the ticket price using `console.log()`. 

**Example:**

```
How old are you? 
> 8 
Your ticket price is: ₹50
```

**Station 2:  Looping Magic**

**Instruction Sheet:**

* Explanation of `while` loops, loop conditions, using `+=` and `-=` for iteration, and nested `while` loops.
* Examples of using `while` loops to generate number patterns.

**Challenge Card:**

**Number Pyramid**

* Ask the user for a number of rows using `questionInt()`.
* Using a `while` loop, create a number pyramid pattern like this (example for 4 rows):

```
   1
  121
 12321
1234321 
```

---

**Station 3: Data Wizards**

**Instruction Sheet:**

* Explanation of arrays, declaring arrays of numbers, accessing array elements using their index (starting from 0), and modifying array elements.

**Challenge Card:**

**Array Average**

* Create an array with these numbers:  `[10, 25, 15, 30, 20]`.
* Using a `while` loop, iterate through the array to calculate the sum of all the numbers.
* Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array.
* Display the average using `console.log()`.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Adjust Difficulty:** Modify challenge complexity based on student skill levels. 
* **Time Limits:**  While the overall activity is 1 hour, you can set time limits per station to add a bit of pressure!
* **Prizes (Optional):**  Small prizes for the winning team or for exceptional problem-solving can add excitement.
