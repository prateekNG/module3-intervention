## Javascript Relay Race: Cracking the Code Together! 

Let's make learning Javascript fun and ditch the boring stations! Get ready for a "Javascript Relay Race" where each group will race against the clock to solve Javascript puzzles. 

**Think of it like a game of Kho-Kho, but with code!**  Each group will take turns solving challenges, and the fastest group with the most correct answers wins! 

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Team Up!** Divide the class into three groups (Group A, Group B, Group C). 
2. **Challenge Stations:**  We'll have three challenge stations, each focused on a key Javascript concept:
    * **Station 1:  Variable Victory!** 
    * **Station 2: Looping Lagoon!**
    * **Station 3: Array Adventure!**
3. **Relay Race Begins!**
    * Each group will start at a different station.
    * One member from each group will step up to solve a coding challenge on a shared computer or whiteboard.  
    * Once they solve it and explain their logic, they tag in a teammate to run to the next station and tackle the next challenge! 
4. **Time Flies!** There will be a time limit for each challenge to keep the energy high! Think of it like those exciting rapid fire rounds in quizzes! 
5. **Points Galore!**
    * Each correct solution earns points for the team.
    * The faster you solve it, the more points you score!
    * Bonus points for explaining your code clearly like a true coding champ!

**Challenge Station Details:**

**Station 1: Variable Victory!**

* **Challenge 1:**  Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle.  *(Tests: Variable declaration, arithmetic operators)*
* **Challenge 2:**  Write a program to check if a person is old enough to vote (voting age is 18).  *(Tests:  Variable declaration, comparison operators, `if-else` statements)*
* **Challenge 3:**  A fruit vendor buys mangoes at a certain price and sells them at a higher price. Calculate his profit. *(Tests: Multiple variable assignments, arithmetic operators, `console.log()`)*

**Station 2: Looping Lagoon!**

* **Challenge 1:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.  *(Tests: `while` loop, incrementing)*
* **Challenge 2:** Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 50 using a `while` loop. *(Tests: `while` loop, comparison operators, arithmetic operators, incrementing)*
* **Challenge 3:**  Imagine you have a pile of bricks. You can take away 2 bricks at a time.  Write a program using a `while` loop to see how many times you can take away bricks before there are less than 2 left. *(Tests: `while` loop, comparison operator, `Math.floor()`, `console.log()`)* 

**Station 3: Array Adventure!**

* **Challenge 1:** Create an array with the heights of 5 friends.  Write a program to find the average height. *(Tests: Array declaration and initialization, accessing array elements, arithmetic operators, `console.log()`)*
* **Challenge 2:**  You are given an array of numbers. Write a program to find the largest number in the array. *(Tests:  Array, `while` loop, comparison operators, `console.log()`)*
* **Challenge 3:** You are a librarian sorting books!  You have an array representing book IDs. Write a program to check if a specific book ID exists in your array. *(Tests:  Array, `while` loop, comparison operators, `console.log()`)*

**Winning Team:**

The team with the most points at the end of all the challenges wins the "Javascript Relay Race"!

**Remember:**

* This is a team effort, so help each other out and cheer each other on!
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes â€“ that's how we learn and grow!
* Most importantly, have fun and enjoy the coding journey!
