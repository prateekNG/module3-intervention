This activity introduces basic JavaScript concepts to students through three interactive learning stations: Variables/Operators/Conditions, While Loops, and One-Dimensional Arrays.  

**Students work in groups, rotating through each station for 20 minutes.**  Each station includes a brief introduction, hands-on coding practice with exercises, and a challenge. 

**Assessment:**  Groups are scored based on code accuracy, speed, and ability to explain their logic.  The group with the highest score wins.  

**Overall, this activity provides a structured and engaging way for students to learn and practice fundamental JavaScript concepts.**
