Brainstorm and list down ideas for station-wise challenges, apart from coding directly, for activities similar to the one below. The activity is an intervention for students struggling with a certain module in a curriculum for teaching JS to first time programmer. The ideas of stations in the original activity is great, keep that in, but ensure a logical progression. Also, the time limits are unrealistic and aribirary, discard them. Come up with engaging activities, and use simple Indian English. Additional resources provided below include the scope for the module, that the activity challenges must not go beyond, and the station-wise scope and objectives, to be refered to while creating challenges. Use them effectively while brainstorming the ideas.


## 1-Hour Activity: JavaScript Learning Stations<a id="1-hour-activity-javascript-learning-stations"></a>

This activity will engage three groups of students (Group A, Group B, and Group C) with basic JavaScript concepts through interactive learning stations. Each station will focus on a specific topic, and students will rotate through the stations, spending a maximum one and a half hour for all three stations before we can proceed for brief explanations of all three solutions.

**Setup**: 

1. Station 1: Variables, Operators, and If-Else Conditions

2. Station 2: While Loops

3. Station 3: One-Dimensional Arrays

Each station will have a set of three stations with activities, explanations, and challenges related to all three topics.

3. Challenge :

Mini-quiz or coding challenge: Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number, and write a program that finds the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

**Station 3**: One-Dimensional Arrays

Flow of the Activity

1. First 20 minutes:

- Group A starts at Station 1.

- Group B starts at Station 2.

- Group C starts at Station 3.

2. Next 20 minutes:

- Groups rotate to the next station.

- Group A moves to Station 2.

- Group B moves to Station 3.

- Group C moves to Station 1.

3. Last 20 minutes:

- Groups rotate to the final station.

- Group A moves to Station 3.

- Group B moves to Station 1.

- Group C moves to Station 2.

Preparation

- Prepare handouts and exercise sheets for each station.

- Set up computers or tablets with internet access or pre-installed JavaScript environments.

- Ensure each station has enough space and materials for the students.

Scoring and Feedback

- At the end of the activity, gather all groups for a debrief.

- Discuss the challenges and solutions from each station.

- Provide feedback on their performance and clarify any doubts.

- The activity will be in the form of a relay race. Houses can make groups to solve the questions as per the level they are in Module 2 - say conditions, loops or array. Scoring will be based on code accuracy, time taken, and the ability to explain the logic briefly. Higher accuracy, shorter time, and clear explanations will contribute to the winning score.

- Optionally, award points for participation and completion of challenges, and recognize the group with the highest score.
## Scope for the Module: Javascript for Beginners - Key Concepts & Keywords

**I. Getting Started**

- Computers (basic)
- Binary Logic (basic)
- Coding (definition)

- Declaring variables
- Assigning variables
- Data Types *(working with numbers only)*
- Decimal values
- Multiple variable assignment
- `let` keyword (in a nutshell only)
- Only `Number` is implicitly introduced
- All other data types like `String`, `Boolean`, `BigInt`, `Undefined`, `Null`, `Object`, adn `Symbol` are *beyond the scope of this module*

> ## JavaScript Learning Stations: Objectives and Scope (Station-wise)

This document outlines the learning objectives and scope for a series of JavaScript programming stations designed to introduce fundamental concepts.

**General Notes:**

* **Collaboration:** Students are encouraged to collaborate effectively within their groups to solve problems and complete challenges. 
* **Code Clarity:** Students should be able to explain their code and logic clearly.
* **Accuracy and Efficiency:** Students should strive for accuracy and efficiency in their code.

### Station 1: Variables, Operators, and Conditions

**Objective:**  Students will be able to declare and assign numeric variables, perform arithmetic operations, and utilize comparison operators within conditional statements (if, else if, else) to control program flow.

**Scope:**

* **Variables and Data Types:**
    * Declare variables using `let`.
    * Assign numeric values to variables.
    * Focus solely on the `Number` data type. 
* **Input/Output:**
    * Use `questionInt()` from `readline-sync` for numeric user input.
    * Use `console.log()` to display output.
* **Operators:**
    * Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`.
    * Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.
    * Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
* **Conditional Statements:**
    * `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements for decision-making.
    * Understand the logical order of conditional statement execution.
    * Chaining multiple `if else` statements to handle various conditions.

**Challenge Example:** Determine if a given year is a leap year.

### Station 2: While Loops

**Objective:** Students will be able to construct and utilize `while` loops to repeat code blocks based on a condition, including nested loops for more complex iterations.

**Scope:**

* **Loops:**
    * Understand the concept and purpose of loops in programming.
    * Construct `while` loops with conditions that evaluate to true or false.
    * Control loop iterations using `+=` and `-=` operators.
    * Create nested `while` loops for iterations within iterations.
    * Apply loop concepts to generate number-based patterns (strings are out of scope).

**Challenge Example:** Calculate the factorial of a given number. 

### Station 3: One-Dimensional Arrays

**Objective:** Students will be able to declare, initialize, access, and modify elements within one-dimensional arrays containing numeric values.

**Scope:**

* **Arrays:**
    * Understand arrays as ordered collections of data.
    * Declare one-dimensional arrays to store numeric data.
    * Initialize arrays with numeric values during declaration.
    * Access individual array elements using their index (zero-based indexing).
    * Modify the values of individual array elements.
    * **Note:** Array methods (beyond accessing and modifying elements) are outside the scope.

**Challenge Example:**  Find the largest/smallest element in an array, reverse the array, or search for a specific value.
