## JavaScript Relay Race: From Flowcharts to Code 

This activity will transform your classroom into a high-energy JavaScript coding arena! Students will compete in teams, racing against the clock to conquer coding challenges based on the concepts from Module 2: Variables, Operators, If-Else, While Loops, and Arrays. 

**Overall Theme:** Relay Race 

**Time:** 1.5 - 2 hours (flexible, adjust challenges as needed)

**Materials:**

* Computers or tablets with JavaScript environments (like JSFiddle, CodePen, or Repl.it)
* Whiteboard or projector for displaying challenges and scores
* Markers or pens 
* Optional: Buzzers for teams to signal completion, small prizes for winning team

**Preparation:**

1. **Divide Students into Teams:** Create balanced teams of 3-4 students, ensuring a mix of skill levels within each team. 
2. **Set Up Stations:** If possible, arrange computers to create a physical "relay race" feel. Otherwise, clearly designate team workspaces. 
3. **Prepare Challenges:** Develop 3 sets of coding challenges, each focusing on a specific Module 2 concept:
    * **Set 1: Variables, Operators, If-Else:**
       * Challenge 1: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and displays the larger number.
       * Challenge 2: Create a program that determines if a given year is a leap year.
    * **Set 2: While Loops:**
        * Challenge 1: Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number using a while loop.
        * Challenge 2: Create a program that finds the sum of all even numbers between 1 and a user-specified number.
    * **Set 3: One-Dimensional Arrays:**
        * Challenge 1: Write a program that finds the average of all the numbers in an array.
        * Challenge 2: Create a program to check if a given element exists in an array.
4. **Designate a "Code Reviewer":** Choose a student (or yourself) to quickly review code for accuracy as teams complete challenges.

**Activity Flow:**

1. **Warm-up (10 minutes):**
    * Briefly review key concepts from Module 2 using interactive examples and student participation. 
    * Explain the rules and scoring system of the relay race.
2. **Relay Race (60-75 minutes):**
    * Each team starts at a designated station (Set 1, Set 2, or Set 3).
    * One member from each team attempts the first challenge in their set.
    * Once a team member believes they have a working solution, they "tag in" a teammate to review the code and explain the logic to the "Code Reviewer".
    * If the code is correct and the logic is sound, the team advances to the next challenge in their set. If not, they continue working on the current challenge.
    * Teams rotate through the challenge sets after a set amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes per set) or once they complete all challenges in a set.
3. **Cool Down & Awards (15 minutes):**
    * Gather all teams together. 
    * Discuss challenges, highlight clever solutions, and address any remaining questions.
    * Announce the winning team (fastest time with all challenges completed correctly) and award prizes (optional). 

**Scoring:**

* Award points for:
    * **Accuracy:**  Each successfully completed challenge earns a set number of points.
    * **Speed:**  Teams receive bonus points based on their overall completion time.
    * **Collaboration:**  Observe teamwork and communication - award bonus points for teams that demonstrate effective collaboration. 

**Adaptations:**

* **Difficulty:** Adjust the complexity of challenges to match your students' skill levels. 
* **Team Size:** Modify team sizes based on your class size.
* **Flow:** If limited to one computer per team, have teams rotate through challenge sets one at a time rather than simultaneously. 

**Why this activity works:**

* **Engaging:** The competitive element and relay race theme create excitement and motivation.
* **Collaborative:** Teamwork is essential for success, encouraging peer learning and support.
* **Practical:** Students apply their coding knowledge to solve real-world problems, reinforcing understanding and building confidence. 
* **Flexible:**  The activity can be adapted to suit different class sizes, skill levels, and time constraints.
