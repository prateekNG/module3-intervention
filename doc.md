## 1-Hour Activity: JavaScript Learning Stations<a id="1-hour-activity-javascript-learning-stations"></a>

This activity will engage three groups of students (Group A, Group B, and Group C) with basic JavaScript concepts through interactive learning stations. Each station will focus on a specific topic, and students will rotate through the stations, spending a maximum one and a half hour for all three stations before we can proceed for brief explanations of all three solutions.

**Setup**: 

1. Station 1: Variables, Operators, and If-Else Conditions

2. Station 2: While Loops

3. Station 3: One-Dimensional Arrays

Each station will have a set of three stations with activities, explanations, and challenges related to all three topics.

**Station 1**: Variables, Operators, and If-Else Conditions

Materials:

- Computers or tablets with JavaScript environments (like JSFiddle or an online compiler)

- Handouts explaining variables, operators, and if-else conditions with examples

- Exercise sheets with problems to solve

Activities:

1. Introduction :

- Brief explanation of what variables and operators are.

- Examples of different types of variables (string, number, boolean).

- Examples of basic operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison).

- Explanation of if-else statements and their syntax with flowcharts.

2. Hands-On Practice :

- Students write small snippets of code to declare variables, use operators, and implement if-else conditions.

- Exercises: Calculate the sum of two numbers, concatenate two strings, compare two values, determine if a number is positive or negative, and check if a user is eligible to vote based on age.

3. Challenge :

- Mini-quiz or coding challenge: Create a simple calculator that performs addition and subtraction, and write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.

**Station 2**: While Loops 

Materials:

- Computers or tablets with JavaScript environments

- Handouts explaining while loops with examples

- Exercise sheets with problems to solve

Activities:

1. Introduction :

- Explanation of while loops and their syntax.

- Discussion of common use cases for while loops.

2. Hands-On Practice :

- Students write code using while loops.

- Exercises: Print numbers from 1 to 10, sum all numbers from 1 to 100.

3. Challenge :

Mini-quiz or coding challenge: Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number, and write a program that finds the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

**Station 3**: One-Dimensional Arrays

Materials:

- Computers or tablets with JavaScript environments

- Handouts explaining arrays with examples

- Exercise sheets with problems to solve

Activities:

1. Introduction :

- Explanation of one-dimensional arrays and their syntax.

- Examples of creating and accessing arrays.

2. Hands-On Practice :

- Students write code to create arrays and perform operations on them.

- Exercises: Create an array of numbers and print each element, find the sum of all elements in an array.

3. Challenge :

Mini-quiz or coding challenge: Write a program that finds the maximum number in an array, and write a program that reverses the elements of an array.

Flow of the Activity

1. First 20 minutes:

- Group A starts at Station 1.

- Group B starts at Station 2.

- Group C starts at Station 3.

2. Next 20 minutes:

- Groups rotate to the next station.

- Group A moves to Station 2.

- Group B moves to Station 3.

- Group C moves to Station 1.

3. Last 20 minutes:

- Groups rotate to the final station.

- Group A moves to Station 3.

- Group B moves to Station 1.

- Group C moves to Station 2.

Preparation

- Prepare handouts and exercise sheets for each station.

- Set up computers or tablets with internet access or pre-installed JavaScript environments.

- Ensure each station has enough space and materials for the students.

Scoring and Feedback

- At the end of the activity, gather all groups for a debrief.

- Discuss the challenges and solutions from each station.

- Provide feedback on their performance and clarify any doubts.

- The activity will be in the form of a relay race. Houses can make groups to solve the questions as per the level they are in Module 2 - say conditions, loops or array. Scoring will be based on code accuracy, time taken, and the ability to explain the logic briefly. Higher accuracy, shorter time, and clear explanations will contribute to the winning score.

- Optionally, award points for participation and completion of challenges, and recognize the group with the highest score.
