## Learning Station Objectives and Scope

**Station 1: Variables, Operators, and Conditions**

**Objective:**  Students will be able to declare and assign numeric variables, perform arithmetic operations, and utilize comparison operators within conditional statements (if, else if, else) to control program flow.

**Scope:**

* **Variables and Data Types:**
    * Declare variables using `let`.
    * Assign numeric values to variables.
    * Understand the concept of data types, focusing solely on the `Number` type. 
* **Input/Output:**
    * Use `questionInt()` from `readline-sync` to get numeric input from the user.
    * Use `console.log()` to display output.
* **Operators:**
    * Apply arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **) to perform calculations.
    * Utilize assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=) for variable manipulation.
    * Employ comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) within conditional statements. 
* **Conditional Statements:**
    * Construct `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements to create decision-making logic.
    * Understand and apply the logical order of conditional statement execution.
    * Chain multiple `if else` statements to handle various conditions.


**Station 2: While Loops**

**Objective:** Students will be able to construct and utilize `while` loops to repeat code blocks based on a condition, including nested loops for more complex iterations.

**Scope:**

* **Loops:**
    * Understand the concept of loops and their purpose in programming.
    * Construct `while` loops with a condition that evaluates to true or false.
    * Control loop iterations using incrementing/decrementing with `+=` and `-=` operators only.
    * Create nested `while` loops to handle iterations within iterations.
    * Apply loop concepts to generate number-based patterns (since strings are out of scope).


**Station 3: One-Dimensional Arrays**

**Objective:** Students will be able to declare, initialize, access, and modify elements within one-dimensional arrays containing numeric values.

**Scope:**

* **Arrays:**
    * Understand the concept of arrays as ordered collections of data.
    * Declare one-dimensional arrays to store numeric data.
    * Initialize arrays with numeric values during declaration.
    * Access individual elements within an array using their index.
    * Modify the values of individual array elements.
    * **Note:** Array methods beyond accessing and modifying individual elements are outside the scope.
