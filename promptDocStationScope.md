Go through the summary of an activity (an intervention for students struggling in a specific module in a programming curriculum for teaching JS to first time programmers) and the scope for the module (which needs to be strictly followed while charting the activity) below, and write detailed/concrete objectives along with strict scope for each learning station, which can refered to while charting the details of the activity later. Neglect the time bounds mentioned in the activity, they are arbitrary and strict.

## Activity Summary
The activity introduces basic JavaScript concepts to students through three interactive learning stations: Variables/Operators/Conditions, While Loops, and One-Dimensional Arrays.  

**Students work in groups, rotating through each station for 20 minutes.**  Each station includes a brief introduction, hands-on coding practice with exercises, and a challenge. 

**Assessment:**  Groups/Individuals are scored based on code accuracy, speed, and ability to explain their logic.

**Activity provides a structured and engaging way for students to learn and practice fundamental JavaScript concepts.** 


## Scope for the Module: Javascript for Beginners - Key Concepts & Keywords

**I. Getting Started**

- Computers (basic)
- Binary Logic (basic)
- Coding (definition)
- Programming (definition, importance)
- Programming Languages (definition)
- Compilers vs. Interpreters (basic, in-depth)
- IDEs (definition)
- Javascript (why?, browser-specific)
- Developer Tools (console)
- NodeJS (basic, in-depth)
- npm (definition, purpose, scripts)
- `readline-sync` package (take input from console)

**II. Fundamentals**

**1. Variables and Data Types**

- Declaring variables
- Assigning variables
- Data Types *(working with numbers only)*
- Decimal values
- Multiple variable assignment
- `let` keyword (in a nutshell only)
- Only `Number` is implicitly introduced
- All other data types like `String`, `Boolean`, `BigInt`, `Undefined`, `Null`, `Object`, adn `Symbol` are *beyond the scope of this module*

**2. Input/Output**

- `question()` and `questionInt()` from the `readline-sync` package
- `console.log()`

**3. Operators**

- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **)
- Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
- Comparison operators (==, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
- `Math.floor()`
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !), pre-post increment (++, --), and strictly equals (===) are *beyond the scope of the module*

**4. Conditional Statements**

- `if` statements
- `else` statements
- `else if` statements
- Logical order of statements
- Chaining `if else` statements

**5. Loops**

- `while` loops only
- Incrementing/Decrementing, *using only += and -= operators*, since pre-post increment-decrement are beyond the scope of the module
- Nested `while` loops
- Since `String` data-type is beyond the scope of the module, star-patterns can be made with numbers.

**6. Arrays**

- Single dimensional arrays of numbers only
- Array declaration
- Array initialization
- Accessing array elements
- Modifying array elements

**(Note: Depth or limits are indicated in parentheses next to each concept/keyword.)** 

> Important: The concepts of functions, objects, string, logical operators, nested loops, etc are beyond the scope of this module and the summative assessments won't include questions from these concepts.
