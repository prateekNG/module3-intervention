## Learning Station Objectives:

**Station 1: Variables/Operators/Conditions**

**Objectives:**

* **Declare and assign values to variables using `let` keyword.**  Students should be able to differentiate between declaring and assigning and understand the role of the `let` keyword.
* **Perform arithmetic operations on numeric variables using operators (+, -, *, /, %, **) and assign the result to new variables.** Students should be able to use these operators to perform basic mathematical calculations in JavaScript.
* **Utilize comparison operators (==, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) to compare numeric values and store the boolean result.** Students should understand the different comparison operators and their purpose in evaluating conditions.
* **Construct `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements to control program flow based on conditions.** Students should be able to write conditional statements that execute different blocks of code based on the truth value of specific expressions.
* **Apply `Math.floor()` function to round down decimal numbers to the nearest integer.** Students should be able to use this function to manipulate decimal values effectively.
* **Solve a challenge that combines the use of variables, operators, and conditional statements.** This challenge should assess their ability to integrate these concepts and apply them to a practical problem, for example, determining if a given year is a leap year. 

**Station 2: While Loops**

**Objectives:**

* **Construct `while` loops to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specific condition remains true.** Students should understand the syntax of a `while` loop and the importance of the condition.
* **Utilize incrementing/decrementing operators (+=, -=) to control loop iterations.** Students should be able to manipulate loop counter variables to execute the loop a desired number of times. 
* **Implement nested `while` loops to solve problems that require iterating over multiple levels.** Students should be able to understand and use nested loops to generate patterns or perform more complex iterations, for example, printing a numerical pyramid pattern.
* **Solve a challenge that requires the application of `while` loops and numeric operations.** The challenge should encourage students to think critically about how to achieve a desired output using loops, for example, finding the factorial of a number.

**Station 3: One-Dimensional Arrays**

**Objectives:**

* **Declare and initialize single-dimensional arrays containing numeric values.** Students should be able to create arrays and populate them with initial values.
* **Access individual elements within an array using their index.** Students should understand zero-based indexing and be able to retrieve specific elements from an array.
* **Modify the value of an element at a specific index within an array.** Students should be able to update the content of an existing array.
* **Iterate through an array using a `while` loop and access/modify each element.** Students should combine their knowledge of loops and arrays to perform operations on each element in the array, for example, calculating the sum of all elements in an array.
* **Solve a challenge that requires manipulating and processing data stored in an array.**  This could involve finding the largest/smallest element, reversing the array, or searching for a specific value within the array.

**Throughout all stations:**

* Students should demonstrate the ability to explain their code and logic clearly.
* Students should strive for accuracy and efficiency in their code.
* Students should collaborate effectively within their groups to solve problems and complete challenges.
