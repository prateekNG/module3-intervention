* **1 Mark Questions (3 Questions):**
    * **Pattern 7:** Identify the code block that will execute based on a given condition in an `if`, `else if`, `else` statement.
        * Example:  Given `x = 10`, which code block will execute? (Provide an `if`, `else if`, `else` statement with conditions based on `x`).
        * Focus: Understanding the flow and execution of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

* **2 Mark Questions (1 Question):**
    * **Pattern 8:** Analyze a code snippet with nested `if` or chained `if else` statements to determine the final output.
        * Example: What will be the output of the following Javascript code? (Provide code snippet with nested `if` or chained `if else` statements)
        * Focus: Tracing logic and predicting output in more complex conditional structures. 

**Section 4: Loops (15 marks)**

* **3 Mark Questions (4 Questions):**
    * **Pattern 9 (2 Questions):** Predict the output of a `while` loop with specific conditions and increment/decrement operations.
        * Example: What will be printed to the console after the following code runs? (Provide a `while` loop with incrementing/decrementing counters)
        * Focus: Understanding how loops iterate and modify variables to achieve a specific outcome.
    * **Pattern 10 (2 Questions):** Analyze a nested `while` loop to determine the number of iterations or the final output. 
        * Example: How many times will the inner loop execute in the following code? (Provide a nested `while` loop) 
        * Focus: Understanding the interaction between inner and outer loops and their combined effect. 

* **1 Mark Questions (3 Questions):**
    * **Pattern 11:** Identify the correct syntax for a `while` loop, incrementing/decrementing, or basic loop components.
        * Example: Which line of code correctly demonstrates a `while` loop with an incrementing counter? (Provide options with different loop syntax)
        * Focus: Recognizing and recalling the fundamental syntax elements of `while` loops. 

**Section 5: Arrays (15 marks)**

* **3 Mark Questions (4 Questions):**
    * **Pattern 12 (2 Questions):** Predict the output of code that manipulates elements in a single-dimensional array. 
        * Example: What will be the contents of the array `numbers` after the following code executes? (Provide code that modifies elements within an array).
        * Focus: Understanding how to access and modify array elements using indices and loop structures.
    * **Pattern 13 (2 Questions):** Analyze a code snippet that combines arrays, loops, and conditional statements to determine the output.
        * Example: What will be the final output after the following code executes? (Provide code that iterates through an array, applies conditions, and potentially modifies elements).
        * Focus:  Applying knowledge of arrays, loops, and conditional statements to solve complex problems.

* **1 Mark Questions (3 Questions):**
    * **Pattern 14:** Identify the correct syntax for declaring, initializing, or accessing elements in a single-dimensional array.
